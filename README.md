Predicting Delivery Delays with Machine Learning 🚚⏱️
This project is part of the Final Project of the Data Science Program at Dibimbing.id. The objective is to predict whether a shipment will be delayed or not using machine learning techniques, and to understand what factors contribute most to these delays.

.

🧠 Business Understanding
An e-commerce company wants to proactively mitigate delivery delays. Two key questions addressed:

1. Which features most influence whether a delivery is delayed?
2. Can we build a predictive model to anticipate delays?

📦 Dataset Overview
The dataset includes:

Shipping details (warehouse block, mode of shipment, weight)
Customer information (gender, care calls, prior purchases, rating)
Product details (cost, importance, discount)
Target variable: Reached on time (1: Yes, 0: No)
